# Wallcopter: UIC Senior Design Project, 2022-2023 Team 13

## Desription
This project focuses on developing an innovative drone capable of inspecting the undersides of bridges and high-rise buildings. The aim is to create a prototype drone that can closely approach or touch target surfaces for thorough inspection while being controlled wirelessly. The project prioritizes functionality, creation of a minimum viable prototype, and cost-effectiveness.
